title: Thanksgiving 2013
---

The following is a document adapted from tweets, which no longer exist because Twitter, that I posted in real time during Thanksgiving weekend 2013. 

## Wednesday

So many notable mishaps and hijinks have happened in the 4 hours since my in-laws got here that I’ve already lost track.

---

20 year old brother-in-law hauled his whole gaming desktop setup from New Jersey for the weekend; we have no desks and his machine doesn’t have wifi.

---

Mother-in-law’s driver seat auto-adjusts every time she gets in, crushing the legs of anyone behind her. She doesn’t know how to stop it.

---

Went to the Pharmacy for dinner. Mom-in-law almost fell on the next table and caught herself, punched bro-in-law in the nose on the way down.

---

These are just the highlights. Plenty more to come, I’m sure. Just let it be known how much I truly love these people. How could I not?

## Thursday

Mother-in-law: “What’s a wifi adapter? Is that something you could pick up at CVS or Walgreens or something?”

---

Against all odds and a realization that “developer” != “hardware troubleshooter,” bro-in-law has set up his gamer PC on a spare side table.

---

Meanwhile, in the kitchen, I’m the only one who knows how to operate a french press, the microwave timer and the smoke alarm.

---

My mother-in-law just tried to open the wine with a can opener. Happy Thanksgiving!

---

As Thanksgiving dinner begins:
Erin: “What do you want to eat?”
Brother-in-law: “Something cheesy.”
E: “We made mac & cheese!”
B: “I want grilled cheese.”
E: “I can make you one.”
B: “No, I want a *good* one.”

## Friday

Mother-in-law in Whole Foods: \[nearly hits three people with her cart\]

---

Mother-in-law in Whole Foods: “What do you mean there’s no electronics section here? Every store has an electronics section.”

---

(She was looking for a network cable for brother-in-law’s gaming PC so he can game online for the last 24 hours of their visit.)

---

Me: “Turn right here.”
Mother-in-law: “Left?”

\[five minutes later\]

Me: “Get in the left lane.”
Mother-in-law: “Right lane?”

## Saturday

Mother-in-law: What’s a Fat Bottom?”
Erin: “It’s a brewery.”
M: “Do you get a fat bottom if you drink one?”

---

Erin: “Would you eat a pizza if we got one?
Brother-in-law: “As long as it’s normal and not some kind of Nashville hipster pizza.”
